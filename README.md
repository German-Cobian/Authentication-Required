# Members-only

An app designed to implement authentication systems so users can only access specific areas and view content of a site they are authorized to do so.

The front end ( http://localhost:3000/ ) displays the landing page of the blog, where the user can sign-in, sign-up or look at all the posts. The posts will only show authors to signed-in users. After a post was successfully created, the user gets redirected to the feed.
