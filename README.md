# Authentication-Required

An app designed to implement authentication systems so users can only access specific areas and view content of a site they are authorized to do so.

The front end `http://localhost:3000/` displays the landing page of the blog, where the user can sign-up log-in or look at all the posts (except the name of the post's author).

![Not-authenticated-display](/app/assets/images/Not-authenticated-display.png?raw=true "Not-authenticated-display")

Signed-up and Logged-in users can create posts

![Enter-post](/app/assets/images/Enter-post.png?raw=true "Enter post")

After a post is successfully created, the user gets redirected to the feed. The posts will only show authors to signed-in users

Signed-up and Logged-in users can also edit their personal information.
